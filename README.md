# Avocados
My first Git Repository.
Author - B SRI VAISHNAVI.

The dataset represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

The aim of this project is to answer the following four questions:
    1. Which region are the lowest and highest prices of Avocado?
    2. What is the highest region of avocado production?
    3. What is the average avocado prices in each year?
    4. What is the average avocado volume in each year?
